# Project - Excel Reader

The goal of this project was to learn about reading data from an Excel Sheet into a database, using the nuget package [EPPlus](https://www.epplussoftware.com/).

The project is part of TheCSharpAcademy: https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/20

### Requirements

*   This is an application that will read data from an Excel spreadsheet into a database
*   When the application starts, it should delete the database if it exists, create a new one, create all tables, read from Excel, seed into the database.
*   You need to use EPPlus package
*   You shouldn't read into Json first.
*   You can use SQLite or SQL Server (or MySQL if you're using a Mac)
*   Once the database is populated, you'll fetch data from it and show it in the console.
*   You don't need any user input
*   You should print messages to the console letting the user know what the app is doing at that moment (i.e. reading from excel; creating tables, etc)
*   The application will be written for a known table, you don't need to make it dynamic.
*   When submitting the project for review, you need to include an xls file that can be read by your application.

### Features of the project

*   Reads in an excel file
*   Stores each row in an SQLServer Database
*   Reads the database and prints out the results to a table

### References
